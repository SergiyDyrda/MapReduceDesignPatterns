    <post Body="&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E7EXW9gdBI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;step by step YouTube guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to delete a Facebook account. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoutingblogger.com/2012/11/How-to-delete-Facebook-account-2013-Permanently-or-Temporally.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this blog article&lt;/a&gt; guiding you through the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that deactivating your Facebook account only makes Facebook temporarily unavailable; it will be reactivated once you login again to your account. So if you are 100% sure you want to delete your account account, only then go for the delete option. It may take 15 days to completely delete your Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"
